<p>HISTORY OF COMPUTING AT DARTMOUTH  (8 November 1983)<br>
48-line explanation.</p>

<p>     The first computer at Dartmouth College was an LGP-30
acquired in<br>
1959.  It could accommodate only one user at a time and was small
and<br>
slow.  The enthusiasm with which it was received, however, revealed
a<br>
strong demand for a better mouse trap.</p>

<p>     In September, 1963, under the direction of mathematics
professors<br>
John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz, a project to establish a time-sharing<br>
system at Dartmouth got under way.  The fruits of this project
were BASIC,<br>
a simplified programming language, and a time-sharing system --
using the<br>
GE-235 and Datanet-30 computers.  This system began operations
in May,<br>
1964.  In 1965, Dartmouth placed off-campus terminals in secondary
schools<br>
in the area.  At the same time, other computer installations began
to use<br>
Dartmouth's system software.</p>

<p>     A larger building was soon necessary.  By 1966, the Kiewit<br>
Computation Center building -- a gift of Peter and Evelyn Kiewit
-- housed<br>
a GE-635 system.  A new operating system -- which later became
known as<br>
the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) -- was written in 1966-1968
for<br>
the GE-635 system.</p>

<p>     Ten years later, in January, 1976, a Honeywell 66/40 replaced
the<br>
GE-635.  The 66/40 was upgraded, made approximately twice as fast,
in<br>
September 1978.  It is now referred to as a 66/DPS-3.  In 1978,
the<br>
operating system was renamed Dartmouth College Time Sharing (DCTS)
when<br>
the rights to the abbreviation DTSS were sold to the Metropolitan
Life<br>
Insurance Company.</p>

<p>     In 1982, we acquired a Honeywell DPS 8/44 computer to
run a second<br>
DCTS system.  This and other computers, which have been added
since 1979,<br>
are connected through special communications cabling and machinery
known<br>
as the Kiewit Network.  The other computers currently on the network<br>
include a Prime 750 which runs the PRIMOS operating system, two
Vax<br>
11/750s running UNIX (a trademark of Bell Laboratories), and a
Vax 11/780<br>
running the VMS operating system.  The College's library catalogs
are<br>
being placed on-line using one of the Vax 11/750s.</p>

<p>     In 1983, the Trustees of Dartmouth College trademarked
the name<br>
DARTMOUTH STRUCTURED BASIC programming language to refer to the
latest<br>
version of Basic designed to closely meet the proposed ANSI standard.</p>

<p>     Computing at Dartmouth is unique because of Kiewit's policy
of<br>
allocating free computer time to all students, faculty, and staff.
 Fully<br>
85% of Dartmouth's students eventually use the computing services.</p>
